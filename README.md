# UPDATE
I'VE MOSTLY STOPPED ADDING/UPDATING PROJECTS IN HERE.

NEW MALWARE I DEVELOP HAS THEIR OWN REPOSITORIES (for the most part)

ANYTHING IN HERE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED OLD, LEGACY, GARBGE, OR EXAMPLES.


This stuff is malware or the code to generate malware based off of ongoing courses I am taking as well as independent research.

I will not publish any destructive malware to this repo. 

While non destructive, please do not execute any of the binaries, office documents, or scripts unless in a sanitary enviornment to analyze them.
